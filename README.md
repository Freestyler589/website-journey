# website-journey
My journey on how to create websites, icnluding examples of a webite that I made at every stage of learning.

## html
My journey with html originally started with me messing around with chatgpt to try and learn more about html, css, and javascript.
However, this repo was created long after that, this repo and the entire idea of this journey started as I was doing some courses on freecodecamp.org.
While working through their basic html course this idea came to me, so I decided to do it, and to document my journey on trying to learn web design. (freecodecamp html course started 20 Feb. 2025 and finished around midnight)
